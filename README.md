## Wallet Integration

#### Wallet Creation and Management:
- **Komet Wallet Integration**: BharatBox has incorporated the Komet Wallet into its ecosystem to provide users with the ability to securely create and manage digital wallets.
- **NFT and Asset Storage**: These digital wallets enable the storage of NFTs and other digital assets, including virtual land, which users can buy, sell, or trade within the platform.
- **In-platform Purchases**: The wallet also facilitates in-platform transactions, allowing users to purchase items or services offered within BharatBox.

#### Transaction Process:
- **Support for Various Transactions**: The Komet Wallet is designed to handle a range of transaction types, including the acquisition and disposal of NFTs, trading of virtual land, and asset transfers between users.
- **Advanced Encryption**: All transactions are safeguarded using state-of-the-art encryption methods, ensuring the security and integrity of user assets.
- **Sand Token Purchase**: The wallet allows purchase of Sand Token on Polygon Chain. Using the Onmeta Purchase service.
![Alt text](image-10.png)

#### User Authentication and Security:
- **Komet Social Login**: For user authentication, BharatBox utilizes Komet Social Login, which streamlines the sign-in process and integrates with the wallet system.
- **Encryption and Token-Based Security**: Wallets are encrypted, and additional security is provided through Google Authentication and Bearer Token login mechanisms, which add layers of security to user sessions and transactions.
- **Shamir Secret Sharing Algorithm**: A critical aspect of the security infrastructure is the use of the Shamir Secret Sharing algorithm to secure private keys. This cryptographic method splits the private key into multiple shares, requiring a subset to reconstruct the original key, thereby enhancing security.

### Wallet Architecture:

![Alt text](image-11.png)

#### Private Key Encryption and Distribution:
- **Shamir Secret Sharing**: The private key of a user's wallet is encrypted using the Shamir Secret Sharing algorithm. This method splits the private key into three separate shares.
- **Secure Storage Locations**: Each share of the encrypted private key is stored in a different, user-controlled location:
    - **Share 1**: Stored in device local storage, which provides convenient and quick access for the user.
    - **Share 2**: Kept in ZK-AUTH IPFS (Zero-Knowledge Authenticated InterPlanetary File System), a decentralized and secure storage solution that uses zero-knowledge proofs to ensure privacy and security.
    - **Share 3**: Located in the backend, likely in a secured database managed by BharatBox's infrastructure.

By distributing the key shares across different storage mediums, BharatBox ensures that the user's wallet can only be accessed when the requisite number of key shares are combined, thereby protecting against unauthorized access and enhancing overall wallet security.

### Additional Security Considerations:

#### Backend Security:
- **Authentication Service**: The backend is fortified by an Authentication Service that secures user registration and login. It manages sessions, devices, and login methods, ensuring that user credentials are securely handled.
- **API Gateway**: The API Gateway acts as the central point for backend requests. It filters requests through a series of security measures designed to block any malicious or unidentifiable sources from accessing the backend system.

The provided link to the Komet SDK beta documentation likely contains additional technical details on the implementation and usage of the SDK, which underpins the wallet functionality within BharatBox. This SDK would typically provide developers with the tools necessary to integrate Komet Wallet features, such as user authentication, wallet creation, transaction signing, and more, into the BharatBox platform.

The combination of secure wallet management, encrypted transactions, and robust authentication and security measures demonstrates BharatBox's commitment to providing a safe and user-friendly environment for its metaverse participants.

## Security Measures 

BharatBox is dedicated to providing a secure environment for its users by implementing rigorous security protocols across the platform. This commitment to security is evident in every layer of BharatBox's technology stack and operational procedures.

#### Data Encryption

Sensitive data, whether at rest or in transit, is protected using state-of-the-art encryption algorithms. BharatBox ensures that:

- All user data is encrypted using robust encryption standards before being stored.
- SSL/TLS encryption is used for data being transmitted over the network to prevent interception or eavesdropping.
- Database encryption is employed for all user and transactional data to safeguard against unauthorized database access.

#### Secure Authentication

BharatBox leverages multiple authentication mechanisms to ensure that user accounts are protected against unauthorized access:

- **Google Authentication**: Provides a secure and user-friendly way to manage account access, leveraging OAuth 2.0 protocol for secure authorization.
- **Bearer Tokens**: Used in conjunction with HTTP requests to ensure that the client requesting access to resources is authenticated.
- Each session is carefully managed with session tokens that are generated securely and invalidated upon logout or after a period of inactivity.

#### API Security

APIs are the backbone of interaction between the front end, the backend, and blockchain services. BharatBox has implemented the following measures:

- **API Gateway**: Acts as a protective layer, managing and authorizing API requests. It ensures that only valid and authenticated requests reach the backend services.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protects against denial-of-service attacks and ensures the stability of the service by limiting the number of requests a user can make within a certain timeframe.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that only properly formatted data is processed by the APIs to prevent common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection.

#### Shamir Secret Sharing for Private Key Management

Private keys are critical for the security of blockchain transactions. BharatBox employs Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm to enhance the security of these keys:

- **Key Splitting**: Private keys are split into multiple shares, and a subset of these shares is required to reconstruct the original key.
- **Distributed Storage**: Shares are distributed across multiple storage locations under the user's control, such as device local storage, ZK-AUTH IPFS, and the backend. This not only secures the key against theft but also against the loss of a single storage location.

#### Wallet Architecture

The wallet architecture within BharatBox has been carefully designed with security as a priority:

- **Komet Wallet**: Created and managed via the Komet SDK, which integrates with Ether.js and Alchemy for blockchain transactions.
- **WalletConnect**: Used for secure wallet connectivity, enabling transactions and wallet management across different devices and platforms.

#### Security in Backend Deployment

- **Auth Service**: Ensures secure registration and login, managing user sessions and authentication methods.
- **API Gateway**: Filters all backend requests to eliminate potential threats from unrecognized sources.

By adhering to these rigorous security measures and protocols, BharatBox ensures that its platform remains secure, resilient, and trustworthy for its users, developers, and partners.
